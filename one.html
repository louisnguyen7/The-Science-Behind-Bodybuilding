        <h2>What is Recovery and Fatigue?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text-container">
        <p>
            Recovery is one of the most important aspects of weight lifting. It is the process of allowing your body to repair and rebuild
            muscle tissue that has been stimulated through resistance training. It is very important to be able to recover from your
            workouts, as it is key to getting stronger in the gym and building muscle. Fatigue happens when energy is depleted from your body and can happen
            in your muscles or CNS (central nervous system). Some signs of fatigue are muscle soreness, reduced strength and energy, 
            and more.

        <h2>How to manage your recovery and fatigue</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text-container">
        <p>
            To manage fatigue, you can incorporate more rest days into your workout split. This can ensure that you are getting the most
            adequate rest before each workout session. You can also lower your volume for each exercise. If you are doing 3+ sets for each exercise,
            you can try to lower it to 1 or 2 sets, allowing for less accumulated fatigue. During your workout, you can also 
            rest longer between sets. Resting between 3-5 mins each set is the most optimal range in managing your fatigue during your workout session.
            <br><br>
            To manage recovery, it is important that you get enough sleep (minimum 7 hours) every night and incorporate enough rest days into your split. Sleeping is 
            where most of the muscle repairing happens, so it is essential to get enough sleep every night to maximize muscle growth. Doing light
            movements such as stretching, yoga, or light cardio can also improve recovery. 
            Additionally, a huge factor in recovery is nutrition and hydration. To learn more about nutrition, visit <a href="two.html">Nutrition and Supplements</a>.

    </div>

    <div class="text-container">
        <p> 
            Overall, it is important to listen to your body and to take extra rest days if needed.
            You can do things such as adjust your volume, intensity, frequency, and/or workout split to optimize your fatigue and recovery. Listening to your body will also prevent overtraining, which can lead to 
            injury and even life-threatening outcomes in rare cases.
