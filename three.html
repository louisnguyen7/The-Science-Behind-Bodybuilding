        <p>
            Training optimally means to structure your workout split to maximize
            muscle growth, rest, and performance. This can apply from ordering your exercises to minimize accumulating fatigue,
            to efficiently timing your rest days to recover from your workouts. It also applies to your training form. If you are using momentum when performing 
            an exercise, it can affect your muscle growth and even increase the risk of injury. 
            Overall, training optimally allows for a balanced approach when considering the amount of volume, intensity, and rest you need in your workout split. 
            When training optimally, you need to think about your approach to muscle building, whether if it's in the gym or outside of the gym.

            <h2>How to train optimally</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="text-container">
            <p>
                For bodybuilding, studies show that hypertrophy is stimulated within the 5-30 rep range, so as long as you're in that rep range you will grow muscle. However, to minimize fatigue
                and time, the best rep range for each exercise is in the 5-7 rep range, assuming you take every set to muscular failure. 
                Therefore, as long as you are hitting muscular failure, doing a lower rep range or higher rep range gives you the same muscle stimulus,
                so it is better to opt for the lower rep range to minimize accumulated fatigue.
                <br><br>
                We can see from this study here:
            </p>

            <figcaption>
                Studies comparing low and moderate reps are on the left, and those comparing moderate and high reps are on the right.
                <br>
                Figure from: <a href="https://www.strongerbyscience.com/hypertrophy-range-fact-fiction/">StrongerbyScience</a>
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <div class="text-container">
            <p>
                <br>
                As we can see, there is little to no difference of performing low reps vs high reps. Most of the data cluster between the +/-20% range.
                <br><br>
                To train optimally, we have to apply the principle of 'progressively overloading'. To do this, we need to keep track of the exercise, how much weight you lifted,
                and how many reps you performed. Now every time you hit that muscle group, you can look back at how many reps you performed in your last session. 
                If you were able to perform in the higher range in the 5-7 rep range; for example, if you performed 7 reps of 15lbs last session, then you should increase the weight this session by 5lbs.
                This technique allows you to challenge your muscles as they are adapting to heavier weight, resulting in muscle growth.
            </p>

            <p>
                To train optimally, we need to take every set on every exercise close to muscular failure. This ensures that we have pushed our muscles to 
                their limit, resulting in muscle hypertrophy.
                <br><br>
                We also need to take into account of the ordering of our exercises. In general, compound lifts should always be first, such as squats, 
                bench presses, deadlifts, etc. The rest of the exercises should be isolation lifts such as bicep curls, tricep pushdowns, etc. 
                <br><br>
                A provided YouTube video by Jeff Nippard can help when deciding some exercises based on science:

                Overall, this is the gist of how to train optimally in the gym. However, outside the gym we need to consider our sleep and nutrition.
